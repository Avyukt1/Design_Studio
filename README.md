## Documentation
This is used for web developers in their Design so I kept this app's name `Design Studio`.
You can choose the color and background color directly and type a valid `font` and `font size` else you will get errors.
Then, you can click the `create` button to see the output.
You can copy the code for your style which will be displayed after pressing the `create` button.

## GitHub
I will add more things in the next version 
This is the second version of `Design Studio`
If you want to suggest me, you can create an `issue`. And for suggestions with change in code, you can fork the repository  and create a `Pull Request`.
